    <h4>Operating System Definition</h4>
        An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially 
        loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all the other programs in a computer. 
        The other programs are called applications or application programs. 
        The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services
        through a defined application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly
        with the operating system through a user interface such as a command line
        or a graphical user interface (GUI). <br><br>

        An operating system performs these services for applications:<br><br>

* In a multitasking operating system where multiple programs can be running at the same time,
 the operating system determines which applications should run in what order and how much time 
 should be allowed for each application before giving another application a turn.<br>
* It manages the sharing of internal memory among multiple applications.<br>
* It handles input and output to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers, and dial-up ports.<br>
* It sends messages to each application or interactive user (or to a system operator) about the status of operation and 
any errors that may have occurred.<br>
* It can offload the management of what are called batch jobs (for example, printing) so that the initiating application
  is freed from this work.
